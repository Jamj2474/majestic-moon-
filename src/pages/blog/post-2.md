# My Second Blog Post



Welcome to my _new blog_ about _learning_ Astro! Here, I will share my learning journey as I build a new website.

## What I've accomplished

1. **Adding Dynamic Post List**: First, I created a new dynamic list of posts to update the lists much easier.

2. **Making Tags**: I then learned how to make pages for tags so I can categorize posts into groups.

3. **Making RSS Feed**: Lastly, I installed Astro's official package for creating RSS feeds and configured it to my site. I now have a working Astro page!
